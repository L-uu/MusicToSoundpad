# MusicToSoundpad


This application assists you in playing Spotify music through Soundpad (so you can annoy people with your awful taste in music).


### To Setup:

- Download the latest release **(MusicToSoundpad.zip)**.

- Extract the files to any folder, the **.zip** should include the **MusicToSoundpad.exe** executable.

- Run the console application. On first launch, a folder called **utils** will be created. This is where the necessary dependencies (**yt-dlp.exe** and **ffmpeg.exe**) will be downloaded and kept updated on each launch.

- Make sure Soundpad is running and the desired category is selected as this is where the songs will be added.

- Play a song on Spotify. The song will be immediately paused and then downloaded to your **Music** folder, added to your SoundPad library and start playing.


### To Uninstall:

- Simply delete the **MusicToSoundpad.exe** executable and the **utils** folder containing dependencies.

- Optionally delete all downloaded music from the **Music** folder.
