# MusicToSoundpad


This application assists you in playing Spotify music through Soundpad (so you can annoy people with your awful taste in music).


### To Setup:

- Downloaded the latest release.

- Extract the files to any folder, the **.zip** should include the **MusicToSoundpad.exe** executable and the **utils** folder.

- Run the console application. If **yt-dlp.exe** is missing from the **utils** folder or is outdated, the latest version will be downloaded.

- Make sure Soundpad is running and the desired category is selected as this is where the songs will be added.

- Play a song on Spotify. The song will be immediately paused and then downloaded to your **Music** folder, added to your SoundPad library and start playing.


### To Uninstall:

- Simply delete the **MusicToSoundpad.exe** executable and the **utils** folder containing dependencies.

- Optionally delete all downloaded music from the **Music** folder.
